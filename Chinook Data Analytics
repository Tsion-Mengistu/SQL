--During this project, I utilized the Chinook database downloaded from the internet to investigate and 
-- respond to inquiries by constructing various queries.



--1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

--2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT customerid, firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

--3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.


SELECT inv.invoiceid , c.firstname, c.lastname, 
    inv.invoicedate, inv.billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c
ON c.customerid = inv.customerid
WHERE c.country = 'Brazil';

--4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title like '%sales% agent%';

--5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT distinct billingcountry from chinook.invoices;

--6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.


SELECT emp.lastname, emp.firstname, inv.invoiceid
 FROM chinook.invoices inv
 JOIN chinook.customers cust
 ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid;

--7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT cust.firstname as 'Customer_F.name', cust.lastname as 'Customer_L.name',
 cust.country, emp.firstname as 'Sales_agent F.name', emp.lastname as 'Sales_agent L.name', inv.total
 FROM chinook.invoices inv
 JOIN chinook.customers cust
 ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid;

--8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT count(invoiceid)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate like '2009%';


--9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT sum(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate like '2009%';

--10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tr.name,inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.tracks tr
JOIN chinook.invoice_items inv
ON tr.trackid = inv.trackid;

--11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tr.name as title, ar.name as artist, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.invoice_items inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks tr 
ON tr.trackid = inv.trackid
INNER JOIN chinook.albums al
ON al.albumid = tr.albumid
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON al.artistid = ar.artistid;

--12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT tr.name as 'Track Name', al.title as 'Album Name', me.name as 'Media Type', ge.name as 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks tr
JOIN chinook.albums al
ON al.albumid = tr.albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types me
ON me.mediatypeid = tr.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres ge
ON ge.genreid = tr.genreid;

--13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.firstname as 'Sales_agent F.name', e.lastname as 'Sales_agent L.name', ROUND(sum(inv.total),2) as 'total_sales'
 FROM chinook.invoices inv
 JOIN chinook.customers cust
 ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON e.employeeid = cust.supportrepid
GROUP BY e.employeeid;

--14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.firstname as 'Sales_agent F.name', e.lastname as 'Sales_agent L.name', ROUND(sum(inv.total),2) as 'total_sales'
 FROM chinook.invoices inv
 JOIN chinook.customers cust
 ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
JOIN chinook.employees e
ON e.employeeid = cust.supportrepid
WHERE inv.invoicedate like '2009%'
GROUP BY e.employeeid
ORDER BY total_sales desc  
LIMIT 1;
