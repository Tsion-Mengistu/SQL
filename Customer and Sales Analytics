--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct cus.acctnum

ON cus.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE acctnum <> '' 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count (distinct cus.acctnum), avg(feb.quantity * feb.price) as avg_amount

LEFT JOIN bit_db.customers cus
ON feb.orderid = cus.order_id
WHERE feb.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

--8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT product, sum(quantity) as total_amount

WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

SELECT sum(feb.quantity) / count(cust.acctnum) as avg_quantity

WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
